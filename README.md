## Game Mechanics

### Resource System
- **Mana**: Regenerates every 6 hours to full
- **HP**: Increases with level, heals with gold/gems
- **Gold**: Currency earned from monsters and trading

### Character Stats (3 Trainable Stats)
- **Strength**: Increases melee damage and equipment capacity
- **Speed**: Reduces damage penalty from encumbrance, determines attack order
- **Intelligence**: Provides damage multiplier in PvP (0.75x to 1.50x), required for spells

### Combat Formulas
```
PvE Damage = (Strength + Weapon Damage) Ã— Speed Modifier - Enemy Protection
PvP Damage = (Strength + Weapon Damage) Ã— Speed Modifier Ã— Intelligence Modifier - Enemy Protection
Speed Modifier = 0.5 + 0.5 Ã— (Speed / Encumbrance), capped at 1.0
```

### Progression
- Experience to next level: `150 Ã— (levelÂ²) + 200`
- Max HP: `2 Ã— (levelÂ²) + 3 Ã— level`
- Max Mana: `(level Ã— 3) + 50`
- Starting stats: 10 Strength/Speed/Intelligence each

## Architecture

See [`ARCHITECTURE_ABSTRACT.md`](./ARCHITECTURE_ABSTRACT.md) for detailed system architecture.

### Key Design Principles
- **API-First**: Every action available via REST endpoints
- **Secure Authentication**: httpOnly cookies with CORS support
- **Modern Frontend**: React with Vite for fast development
- **Configurable**: Game mechanics in `/server/config/game.js`
- **Database Security**: Row-level security and atomic operations
- **Production Ready**: Comprehensive test coverage and error handling
