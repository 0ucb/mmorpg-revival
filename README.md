## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn
- Supabase account (free tier works)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/0ucb/mmorpg-revival.git
cd mmorpg-revival
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your Supabase credentials:
```
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your_supabase_service_key
PORT=3000
```

4. Set up the database:
   - Go to your Supabase dashboard
   - Navigate to SQL Editor
   - Run the scripts in order:
     1. `/database/migrate-to-equipment-system.sql` (includes schema + equipment functions)
     2. `/database/api-functions.sql`
     3. `/database/system-tables.sql`
     4. `/database/rls-policies.sql`
   
5. Configure OAuth providers (optional):
   - In Supabase Dashboard â†’ Authentication â†’ Providers
   - Enable Google, Discord, and/or GitHub
   - Set redirect URL to `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback`

6. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

7. Seed game data:
```bash
node database/seeders/monsters.js     # Load monster data
node database/seeders/equipment.js    # Load 51 weapons + 56 armor pieces
```

8. Test the game:
   - Open `http://localhost:3000/test-auth.html`
   - Register a new account and get auth token
   - Use token to test combat: `curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" http://localhost:3000/api/beach/monsters`

## Available Scripts

```bash
npm run dev          # Start development server
npm run scrape       # Run Wayback Machine scraper
npm run db:migrate   # Run database migrations
```

## API Documentation

The API is available at `http://localhost:3000/api/docs` when the server is running.

### Currently Available Endpoints

#### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/register` - Create new account with character
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Login with email/password
- `POST /api/auth/logout` - End current session
- `GET /api/auth/session` - Validate and get session info
- `POST /api/auth/oauth/:provider` - Start OAuth flow (google/discord/github)
- `POST /api/auth/oauth/callback` - Handle OAuth callback

#### Beach Combat
- `GET /api/beach/monsters` - List all 30 monsters with efficiency stats
- `POST /api/beach/fight` - Fight a monster (1 mana per fight)

#### Temple Training
- `POST /api/temple/pray` - Convert mana to stat points (5/50/all mana)
- `GET /api/temple/efficiency` - View current prayer efficiency

#### Equipment System
- `GET /api/equipment/shop` - Browse available equipment for purchase
- `POST /api/equipment/purchase` - Buy equipment with gold
- `GET /api/equipment/inventory` - View equipped items and inventory
- `POST /api/equipment/slot/:slot` - Equip/unequip items in slots

### Coming Soon
- Web interface for all game systems
- Equipment selling back to shop
- Player-to-player trading system
- PvP combat system

## Game Mechanics

### Resource System
- **Mana**: Regenerates every 6 hours to full
- **HP**: Increases with level, heals with gold/gems
- **Gold**: Currency earned from monsters and trading

### Character Stats (3 Trainable Stats)
- **Strength**: Increases melee damage and equipment capacity
- **Speed**: Reduces damage penalty from encumbrance, determines attack order
- **Intelligence**: Provides damage multiplier in PvP (0.75x to 1.50x), required for spells

### Combat Formulas
```
PvE Damage = (Strength + Weapon Damage) Ã— Speed Modifier - Enemy Protection
PvP Damage = (Strength + Weapon Damage) Ã— Speed Modifier Ã— Intelligence Modifier - Enemy Protection
Speed Modifier = 0.5 + 0.5 Ã— (Speed / Encumbrance), capped at 1.0
```

### Progression
- Experience to next level: `150 Ã— (levelÂ²) + 200`
- Max HP: `2 Ã— (levelÂ²) + 3 Ã— level`
- Max Mana: `(level Ã— 3) + 50`
- Starting stats: 10 Strength/Speed/Intelligence each

## Architecture

See [`ARCHITECTURE_ABSTRACT.md`](./ARCHITECTURE_ABSTRACT.md) for detailed system architecture.

### Key Design Principles
- **API-First**: Every action available via REST endpoints
- **Stateless**: JWT authentication, no server sessions
- **Configurable**: Game mechanics in `/server/config/game.js`
- **Secure**: Row-level security on all database tables
- **Clean Code**: No backwards compatibility, forward-looking only
