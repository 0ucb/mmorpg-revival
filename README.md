ðŸš§ **In Active Development** - Foundation Complete

### âœ… Implemented Features
- **Authentication System**: Email/password and OAuth (Google, Discord, GitHub)
- **Character Creation**: Automatic character setup with starting stats
- **Mana Regeneration**: 6-hour cycle resource system
- **Database Security**: Complete RLS policies for all tables
- **API Foundation**: RESTful endpoints with JWT authentication
- **Game Configuration**: All formulas and mechanics from original game

### ðŸ”„ In Progress
- Beach combat system
- Character progression (temple praying)
- Inventory management
- Basic town system

### ðŸ“‹ Planned Features
- **Combat System**: Fight monsters and other players
- **Items & Equipment**: 50+ weapons and armor pieces
- **Quests**: Missions for experience and rewards
- **Towns**: Guild system for group play
- **Trading**: Player-to-player marketplace
- **Town Wars**: Large-scale PvP battles

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn
- Supabase account (free tier works)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/0ucb/mmorpg-revival.git
cd mmorpg-revival
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your Supabase credentials:
```
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your_supabase_service_key
PORT=3000
```

4. Set up the database:
   - Go to your Supabase dashboard
   - Navigate to SQL Editor
   - Run the scripts in order:
     1. `/database/schema.sql`
     2. `/database/api-functions.sql`
     3. `/database/system-tables.sql`
     4. `/database/rls-policies.sql`
   
5. Configure OAuth providers (optional):
   - In Supabase Dashboard â†’ Authentication â†’ Providers
   - Enable Google, Discord, and/or GitHub
   - Set redirect URL to `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback`

6. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

7. Test the authentication:
   - Open `http://localhost:3000/test-auth.html`
   - Try registering a new account
   - Test login functionality

## Available Scripts

```bash
npm run dev          # Start development server
npm run scrape       # Run Wayback Machine scraper
npm run db:migrate   # Run database migrations
```

## API Documentation

The API is available at `http://localhost:3000/api/docs` when the server is running.

### Currently Available Endpoints

#### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/register` - Create new account with character
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Login with email/password
- `POST /api/auth/logout` - End current session
- `GET /api/auth/session` - Validate and get session info
- `POST /api/auth/oauth/:provider` - Start OAuth flow (google/discord/github)
- `POST /api/auth/oauth/callback` - Handle OAuth callback

### Coming Soon
- Beach combat endpoints
- Temple praying endpoints
- Inventory management
- Market/trading system

## Game Mechanics

### Resource System
- **Mana**: Regenerates every 6 hours to full
- **HP**: Increases with level, heals with gold/gems
- **Gold**: Currency earned from monsters and trading

### Character Stats
- **Strength**: Increases melee damage and equipment capacity
- **Speed**: Reduces damage penalty from encumbrance
- **Intelligence**: Provides damage bonus in PvP
- **Defense**: Reduces incoming damage
- **Luck**: Affects loot and critical chances

### Combat Formulas
```
PvE Damage = (Strength + Weapon Damage) Ã— Speed Modifier - Enemy Protection
PvP Damage = (Strength + Weapon Damage) Ã— Speed Modifier Ã— Intelligence Modifier - Enemy Protection
Speed Modifier = 0.5 + 0.5 Ã— (Speed / Encumbrance), capped at 1.0
```

### Progression
- Experience to next level: `150 Ã— (levelÂ²) + 200`
- Max HP: `2 Ã— (levelÂ²) + 3 Ã— level`
- Max Mana: `(level Ã— 3) + 50`
- Starting stats: 10 STR/DEF/AGI/INT, 5 LUCK

## Architecture

See [`ARCHITECTURE_ABSTRACT.md`](./ARCHITECTURE_ABSTRACT.md) for detailed system architecture.

### Key Design Principles
- **API-First**: Every action available via REST endpoints
- **Stateless**: JWT authentication, no server sessions
- **Configurable**: Game mechanics in `/server/config/game.js`
- **Secure**: Row-level security on all database tables
- **Clean Code**: No backwards compatibility, forward-looking only

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please feel free to submit pull requests.

### Development Guidelines
1. Read [`DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md`](./DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md) for roadmap
2. Check [`HANDOFF_AUTH_COMPLETE.md`](./HANDOFF_AUTH_COMPLETE.md) for current state
3. Follow existing code patterns
4. Test all endpoints
5. Update documentation

## Data Recovery

The `/scraper` directory contains tools to recover game data from the Wayback Machine:

```bash
node scraper/wayback-scraper.js    # Basic scraper
node scraper/wiki-scraper.js        # Wiki documentation scraper
node scraper/deep-scraper.js        # Comprehensive scraper
```
