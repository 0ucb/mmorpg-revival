## 6. Create Project Board

## 7. Set Up Automation

In Project settings â†’ Workflows:

1. **Item added to project** â†’ Set status to "Backlog"
2. **Pull request merged** â†’ Set status to "Done"
3. **Issue closed** â†’ Set status to "Done"
4. **Pull request opened** â†’ Set status to "Review"

## Quick Links for Your Repo

Once created, your important links will be:
- Repo: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/marcoland-revival`
- Issues: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/marcoland-revival/issues`
- Project: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/marcoland-revival/projects/1`
- Wiki: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/marcoland-revival/wiki`

## Alternative: Use GitHub's Issue Templates

Instead of creating issues manually, you can use the templates I created:

1. Go to Settings â†’ Features â†’ Issues â†’ Set up templates
2. Add the templates from `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATES/`
3. Now "New issue" will show template options

This manual setup will give you the same result as the automated script!
