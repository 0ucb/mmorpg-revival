# Temple Prayer System - Implementation Complete

## 🎉 System Fully Implemented and Tested

The Temple of Tiipsi prayer system has been successfully implemented according to authentic MarcoLand mechanics, providing players with the ability to spend mana to gain random stat points.

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. Core Game Logic (`/server/config/game.js`)
Added four new functions that handle all prayer mechanics:

- **`distributeStatsWeighted(totalPoints)`** - Intelligently distributes stat points among Strength, Speed, Intelligence
- **`calculateStatGains(currentTotalStats, manaSpent)`** - Calculates stat gains for simple mana amounts
- **`calculateStatGainsWithDiminishing(currentTotalStats, manaSpent)`** - Handles large mana amounts with proper diminishing returns
- **Existing `getPrayingEfficiency(totalStats)`** - Returns authentic efficiency values (3.5/2.5/1.5/1.1)

### 2. API Routes (`/server/routes/temple.js`)
Two new authenticated endpoints:

- **`POST /api/temple/pray`** - Spend mana to gain stat points
  - Accepts `manaAmount`: "5", "50", or "all"
  - Validates player is alive and has sufficient mana
  - Uses transaction-safe updates with rollback capability
  - Returns detailed results including old/new stats and efficiency used

- **`GET /api/temple/efficiency`** - Get current prayer efficiency
  - Shows current stats, efficiency tier, and next threshold
  - Indicates if player can pray (alive + enough mana)

### 3. Server Integration (`/server/index.js`)
- Temple routes integrated with main server
- API documentation updated to include temple endpoints
- Full compatibility with existing beach combat system

### 4. Comprehensive Testing
- **`/server/tests/temple.test.js`** - Full test suite covering core logic, edge cases, API endpoints
- **`test-temple.js`** - Manual core function testing
- **`test-integration-simple.js`** - Integration testing with existing systems

## 🎮 How It Works

### Prayer Mechanics (Authentic MarcoLand)
- **Three Stats Only**: Strength, Speed, Intelligence (no Defense or Luck)
- **Efficiency Tiers**: Based on total trainable stats
  - 0-1099 stats: **3.5** points per 50 mana (High)
  - 1100-1299 stats: **2.5** points per 50 mana (Medium)
  - 1300-1499 stats: **1.5** points per 50 mana (Low)
  - 1500+ stats: **1.1** points per 50 mana (Minimal)

### Prayer Options
- **5 Mana**: Small prayer, usually 0-1 stat points
- **50 Mana**: Standard prayer, gives efficiency amount ±20% variance
- **All Mana**: Uses all available mana with proper diminishing returns

### Diminishing Returns
When praying with large amounts of mana, the system:
1. Processes in 50-mana chunks
2. Recalculates efficiency after each chunk based on new total stats
3. Properly handles efficiency tier transitions within single prayer

## 🔧 API Usage Examples

```bash
# Check current efficiency
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
     http://localhost:3000/api/temple/efficiency

# Pray with 5 mana
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"manaAmount": "5"}' \
     http://localhost:3000/api/temple/pray

# Pray with 50 mana  
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"manaAmount": "50"}' \
     http://localhost:3000/api/temple/pray

# Pray with all available mana
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"manaAmount": "all"}' \
     http://localhost:3000/api/temple/pray
```

## 📊 Example API Response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "mana_spent": 50,
  "stat_gains": {
    "strength": 2,
    "speed": 1,
    "intelligence": 1
  },
  "total_stat_gains": 4,
  "old_stats": {
    "strength": 25,
    "speed": 20,
    "intelligence": 15,
    "total": 60
  },
  "new_stats": {
    "strength": 27,
    "speed": 21,
    "intelligence": 16,
    "total": 64
  },
  "remaining_mana": 30,
  "efficiency_used": 3.5
}
```

## 🛡️ Safety Features

### Transaction Safety
- Updates player stats first, then mana
- Automatically rolls back stats if mana update fails
- Prevents inconsistent database state

### Validation
- Player must be alive (health > 0)
- Must have sufficient mana
- Minimum 5 mana required
- Only accepts valid mana amounts ("5", "50", "all")

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error messages
- Graceful failure with proper HTTP status codes
- Optional audit logging (won't fail prayer if logging fails)

## 🧪 Test Results

All core functionality verified:
- ✅ Efficiency calculations match scraped MarcoLand data
- ✅ Stat distribution is random but balanced over time
- ✅ Diminishing returns work correctly for large prayers
- ✅ Integration with beach combat system confirmed
- ✅ Transaction safety prevents data corruption
- ✅ API endpoints properly authenticated and validated

## 🎯 Complete Player Progression Loop

Players now have the full single-player experience:

1. **Fight Monsters** (Beach) → Gain XP, Gold, Level Up
2. **Pray at Temple** → Convert Mana to Stats  
3. **Better Stats** → Fight Stronger Monsters
4. **Repeat** → Meaningful progression with diminishing returns

## 🚀 Ready for Production

The Temple Prayer System is:
- ✅ **Authentic** - Matches original MarcoLand formulas exactly
- ✅ **Tested** - Comprehensive test coverage for all functionality  
- ✅ **Safe** - Transaction-safe with proper error handling
- ✅ **Integrated** - Works seamlessly with existing beach combat
- ✅ **Scalable** - Efficient algorithms handle large mana amounts
- ✅ **Documented** - Clear API docs and usage examples

## 📝 Next Steps

With the temple system complete, consider implementing:
1. **Equipment System** - Weapons/armor that use improved stats
2. **Shop System** - Spend gold earned from combat
3. **Inventory Management** - Equip/unequip items
4. **Forging System** - Enhance equipment
5. **PvP Combat** - Player vs player with intelligence modifiers

The foundation is now solid for expanding into the full MarcoLand experience!
