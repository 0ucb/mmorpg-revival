## Implementation Details

### Database Schema Changes

#### New Currency Support
```sql
-- Added quartz currency alongside metals and gems
ALTER TABLE players 
ADD COLUMN quartz INTEGER DEFAULT 0 CHECK (quartz >= 0);
```

#### Daily Purchase Tracking
```sql
-- New table for tracking daily limits
CREATE TABLE player_daily_purchases (
    id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
    player_id UUID REFERENCES players(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    purchase_type VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL, -- 'gems', 'mana', 'vote'
    purchase_date DATE DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE,
    quantity INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    gold_spent INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    UNIQUE(player_id, purchase_type, purchase_date)
);
```

#### Database Functions
- `check_daily_limit()` - Validates purchases against daily caps
- `process_daily_purchase()` - Atomic purchase processing with limit enforcement
- `purchase_gems()` - Specific gems purchasing (90g each, 30/day limit)
- `daily_vote()` - Daily voting system (500-1000g + rare mana reload)
- `purchase_mana_tree()` - Mana purchasing (100 gems = 1 max mana)

### Backend API Architecture

#### Removed Components
- **Unified Equipment Shop**: Completely removed `GET /api/equipment/shop` and `POST /api/equipment/purchase`
- **Mixed Shop Logic**: Eliminated code that handled both weapons and armor together

#### New NPC Shop Endpoints

**Blacksmith** (`/api/blacksmith`)
- `GET /` - Lists weapons only, sorted by cost
- `POST /purchase` - Buys weapons only, rejects armor purchases
- Validates weapon requirements and player affordability

**Armourer** (`/api/armourer`) 
- `GET /` - Lists armor only, grouped by slot (head/body/legs/hands/feet)
- `POST /purchase` - Buys armor only, rejects weapon purchases
- Provides slot-organized data for frontend display

**Gems Store** (`/api/gems-store`)
- `GET /` - Shows daily purchase status (purchased/remaining out of 30)
- `POST /purchase` - Enforces 30 gems daily limit at 90g each
- Tracks daily limits with automatic reset at midnight

**Market** (`/api/market`)
- `GET /` - Placeholder for future player trading system
- Returns planned features and current player resources
- Infrastructure ready for full marketplace implementation

**Resources** (`/api/resources`)
- `GET /vote` & `POST /vote` - Daily voting (500-1000g + 5% mana reload chance)
- `GET /mana-tree` & `POST /mana-tree/purchase` - Max mana purchasing (100 gems = 1 max mana)
- One vote and one mana purchase per day limits

### Frontend Implementation

**GemsStoreScreen.jsx** - Daily gems purchasing:
- Displays daily limit status (purchased/remaining out of 30)
- Batch purchase options (1, 5, 10, all remaining)
- Real-time cost calculation
- Daily limit enforcement with clear messaging

**MarketScreen.jsx** - Future player trading placeholder:
- Explains planned marketplace features
- Shows current player resources (gold, gems, metals, quartz)
- Educational content about original MarcoLand trading

**VoteScreen.jsx** - Daily voting interface:
- Clear daily voting status and rewards earned
- Large "VOTE HERE! DO IT" button matching original
- Reward information (500-1000g + 5% mana reload chance)
- Daily reset information

**ManaTreeScreen.jsx** - Mana purchasing interface:
- Shows gems required (100) and current max mana
